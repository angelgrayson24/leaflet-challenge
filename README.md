# Earthquake Data Visualization

This project involves creating a visualization of earthquake data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The goal is to build an interactive map that displays earthquake information in a meaningful way.

## Project Overview

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) collects earthquake data from around the world, updating the information every 5 minutes. This project focuses on visualizing this data using the Leaflet library for mapping and D3.js for data manipulation and visualization.

## Features

- **Earthquake Map:** Displays earthquake markers on a map based on their latitude, longitude, magnitude, and depth.

- **Marker Styling:** Marker size represents earthquake magnitude, and marker color represents the depth of the earthquake.

- **Tooltips:** Each marker on the map has a tooltip that provides additional information about the earthquake, including magnitude, depth, and location.

- **Legend:** A legend is included to provide context for the color scale used in the map, indicating different depth ranges.

# Usage
The map will be displayed with earthquake markers.
Hover over a marker to view a tooltip with detailed information.
The legend provides context for the color scale used in the map.

# Libraries and APIs Used
Leaflet: An open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.
D3.js: A JavaScript library for data visualization.
